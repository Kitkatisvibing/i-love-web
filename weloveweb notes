Voice recognition history:
	19502/1960s first attempts voice recognition
	1970s/1980s improvement
	1990s dragon dictate en ibm viavoice
	2000s google introduces voice search
	2010s smart assistans (siri, alexa)

Change in how people find information

Ai chats r a thing now

Elevenlabs for voice generation

Performance over anything
Nothing breaks the illusion more than high latency

Ai is just another data source
It’s the UX that makes the difference

Don’t forget abt older techniques
